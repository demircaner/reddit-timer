## About This Project

Reddit is one of the most popular places to share and promote content. Reddit Timer helps content creators to find the right time to share their content on Reddit so they can reach more people.

I implemented this project in the context of a course at ooloo.io. This course mimics a professional real-world development environment.

Designs were provided via Figma. The project was split into small tasks using Clickup as a project management tool. I created a pull request for every task. The code was reviewed and feedback provided if necessary.

In this project I have been exposed to many practical techniques. Examples as following but not limit to:

- Creating pixel-perfect designs
- Planning and implementing a complex UI component
- Implement data fetching with error handling
- Debugging inside an IDE
- Writing integration tests
- Professional Git workflow with pull requests
- Code reviews
- Continuous integration

I was free to choose any technical stack, packages, and coding styles to finish the project as long as I met the acceptance criteria of a given task. The only limitation was to use React. The code reviews gave me insights into best practices to follow. I was able to learn a lot and evolve my front-end knowledge rapidly.
